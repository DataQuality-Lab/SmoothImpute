This design not only streamlines the imputation process but also offers user-centric feedback tailored to specific needs, leveraging a memory bank comprising manuals, codebases, and historical experimental results across 500 real-world and synthetic datasets. \nIn this demonstration, we showcase \\framework~using real-world datasets, offering participants access to various Python scripts within Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, we deploy the software to enable participants to: (1) explore the diverse functionalities of \\framework, and (2) select imputation methods customized to address their unique imputation needs.\n    \n\\end{abstract}"
